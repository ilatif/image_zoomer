image_zoomer
============

This jQuery plugin allows you to have zoom effect for your images. CSS based zooming solutions exist but they work by resizing target image to make it look small and then setting CSS properties to view portions of that image given a illusion that image is zoomed. It is not actual zooming as user is just seeing true version of target image.

This plugin actually zooms images by using `canvas`.
